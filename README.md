### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Next.js web platform for eSports teams, comparing its performance to a WordPress version for my thesis.
- 🌱 I’m exploring Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Next.js 15 for web development.
- 🎮 I’m the leader and founder of the eSports team at Hochschule Pforzheim, playing League of Legends competitively.
- 🤝 Open to discussions about web development, gaming, and eSports management.
- 💬 Ask me about JavaScript, web performance, and database optimization.
- 🏍️ When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me riding my motorcycle or competing in games.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I daily-drive an oldtimer VW Golf II.
